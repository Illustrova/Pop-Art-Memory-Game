# Memory Game Project

A project for Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree.

## Details

Original project requirements can be found in [this pdf](memory-game-project-rubric.pdf), and starter repository [here](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game).
The layout was rebuilt from scratch using custom SVG sprites and complex CSS/SVG transitions. Animation techniques should be considered experimental, rather as proof of concept, as their productivity is pretty low.
